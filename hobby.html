      <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
      <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is cycling. I enjoy riding my bicycle early
        in the morning or in the afternoon when the weather is calm. It gives me
        a sense of freedom and keeps me physically and mentally active. I love
        the feeling of fresh air and exploring different places around my area.

      <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
      <p>
        Cycling is not just exercise for me — it's something that helps me relax
        and clear my mind. It keeps me healthy and fit, and I always feel
        refreshed after a ride. Sometimes, I listen to music while cycling
        through quiet roads, and it feels peaceful and enjoyable.

      <h2>Where I Go</h2>
      <p>
        I often go cycling around my neighborhood, local parks, and sometimes a
        bit further when I have more time. Riding through green areas and open
        roads gives me joy. I also enjoy cycling with my friends when we all
        have free time during holidays or weekends.

      <h2>My Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
        I hope to take cycling more seriously in the future — maybe even join a
        cycling club or participate in events. It's a hobby that keeps me
        active, teaches me discipline, and gives me goals to chase. I want to
        continue it as I grow older and stay strong and healthy.
