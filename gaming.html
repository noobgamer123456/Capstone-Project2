      <h2>Valorant</h2>
      <p>
        Valorant is my favorite game. Its a competitive 5v5 tactical shooter
        developed by Riot Games that combines sharp shooting with special agent
        abilities. I love the intensity of every match, the teamwork it demands,
        and the excitement when pulling off a clutch play.

      <h2>My Favorite Agents</h2>
      <p>
        My favorite agents are Jett, Reyna, and Phoenix. I like Jett for her
        speed and aggressive playstyle, Reyna for her healing and damage
        potential, and Phoenix for his self-revive and flash abilities. Each
        agent feels unique and helps me enjoy the game in different ways.

      <h2>Game Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Valorant isnt just about shooting — its about strategy. I always focus
        on communication, map control, and smart utility use. Every round is a
        chance to improve my skills. Whether Im defending a site or attacking
        with my team, I always try to stay calm and think ahead.

      <h2>Why Its Special</h2>
      <p>
        What makes Valorant special to me is its mix of skill, team
        coordination, and cool design. Ive met new friends through the game and
        had some unforgettable clutch moments. Valorant keeps me excited and
        motivated to play better every day.
